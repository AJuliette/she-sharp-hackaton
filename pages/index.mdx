      I want a job in:

      <TextField label="City" name="city" />

      I don't want to work in those:
      <Autocomplete
        multiple
        options={categories}
        renderInput={(params) => (
          <TextField

          />
        )}
      />
      They're evil.

      I'm looking for a job as a:
      <TextField label="Job Title" name="job_title" />

    This is the amount of other humans I'm willing to work with:
      <Autocomplete
        disablePortal
        name="employee_range"
        options={employee_ranges}
        sx={{ width: 300 }}
        renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} label="employee range" name="employee_range" />}
      />

    I don't want you to show up if your job offer contains those:
      <Autocomplete
        multiple
        options={red_flags}
        renderInput={(params) => (
          <TextField
            {...params}
